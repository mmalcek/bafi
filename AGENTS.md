# AGENTS Instructions

## Development
- Format Go code with `gofmt -w` before committing.
- Run `go test ./...` and ensure all tests pass.

## Documentation
- If you modify files under `docs/` or `mkdocs.yml`, run `mkdocs build` to check that the documentation builds successfully (if mkdocs is available).
